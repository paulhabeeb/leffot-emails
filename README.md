# Email Templates

MJML templates for marketing campaigns and transactional emails. MJML is a framework for creating responsive emails that behave well on the most popular email clients.

## BigCommerce

Emails sent to customers when they place an order, register a new account, reset their password, and the like. These templates are rarely modified after their initial design.

## Mailchimp

We send two kinds of marketing emails: (1) general marketing campaigns about new products, events, and store hours, and (2) notifications of new pre-owned shoes. General campaigns are composed from a few basic components that can be configured in numerous ways. Pre-owned notifications are sent with a standardized template.
