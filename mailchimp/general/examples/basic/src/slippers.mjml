            Room slippers, as theyâ€™re called in Japan, are worn from room to
            room. In the US we call them house shoes or, simply, slippers.

        <mj-text mj-class="section-text">
            But these are no ordinary slippers. Just like the fine quality shoes
            made by the Hiro Yanagimachi team, these room slippers are handmade
            in Tokyo in your choice of color and size.

            We are excited to offer monograms as a new way to add a personal
            touch to your slippers. You can customize a pair on our website.
